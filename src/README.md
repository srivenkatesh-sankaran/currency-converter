## Instructions

- I developed this project completely on Codesandbox. If you would like to preview the project on Codesandbox or if you have any issues running it locally, please let me know.

- Running the project locally should be as simple as running,
`npm install`
`npm start`

- I went with minimalistic design since I did nt want to spend too much time on the project and wanted to keep it relatively simple.

- The project instructions asked for a button, but I went with a dropdown and conversion based on the selection in order to avoid an extra click for my design. Since it was open ended I went with what made the most sense.

- I enjoyed working on it and thanks for the opportunity to implement it!
